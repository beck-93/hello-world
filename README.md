# hello-world
no idea what I'm doing yet but I'm here trying my best! 

I'm a recovering perfectionist building my confidence in statistical analysis and coding. It's something I've tried in the past but often got frustrated and gave up whenever I couldn't figure it out. This time is different. There seems to be a lot more support and resources available to me than when I was learning SAS. Can't wait to try my hand at R Studio and GitHub!
